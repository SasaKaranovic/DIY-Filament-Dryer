# Building the Hardware

### Schematic
Schematic files are available in `Schematic.pdf` as well as Altium source files.
This file should be enough to understand how things are connected and how hardware works.

Bill of Material is available in `Bill of Materials.pdf`.
Most parts are interchangable, so feel free to source these parts from your favorite part distributor.
When replacing capacitors, make sure you choose the same voltage rating!

### How can I order the PCB

I have prepared Gerber files that are verified and ready to go. You can take `Release\2021-12-07_23-28_DryBox_R1\2021-12-07_23-28_DryBox_R1_Gerber.zip` and upload it to your favorite PCB manufactuer like PCBWay, SeeedStudio, JLCPCB.
There are no critical PCB specs, so you can select whichever one you prefer.
